üöÄ with Deployment Boilerplate on Digital Ocean

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/jailsonsb2/fastapi-streamtitle-bd/tree/main/)

## Overview

FastAPI Stream Title Metadata Extractor is a simple application that allows users to obtain the title from the metadata of an audio stream and extract the artist and song name from it. It uses the FastAPI library to create a web API that accepts the URL of an MP3 audio stream as input and returns the artist and song name in JSON format.

This repository serves as a minimal boilerplate for deploying a FastAPI application on Digital Ocean. It's designed to provide a straightforward way to get your FastAPI application running with the least amount of headache and bloatware.

## Features

- Retrieval of the title from the metadata of an audio stream
- Extraction of the artist and song name from the stream title
- Minimal FastAPI setup
- Ready-to-deploy on Digital Ocean
- Basic configurations for a quick start

## Requirements

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveat

This boilerplate is intentionally barebones. It's crafted to solve the deployment problem with simplicity and efficiency, without extra features or complexity. It's not meant to be an exhaustive setup but rather a starting point for deploying FastAPI applications on Digital Ocean.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Click the "Deploy to DO" button at the top.
2. Follow the instructions on Digital Ocean to deploy your app.
3. Enjoy your FastAPI app running in the cloud!
